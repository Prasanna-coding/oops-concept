# oops-conceptObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. Classes act as blueprints, defining the structure and behavior (data and methods) of objects. OOP aims to make software development more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain by leveraging concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
